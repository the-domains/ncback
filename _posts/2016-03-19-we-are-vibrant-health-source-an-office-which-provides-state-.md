We are Vibrant Health Source an office which provides state-of-the-art personalized care. It is one of our top priorities to protect the well-being of our valued patients. We are confident that you will feel right at home in our office as we welcome all patients as if they were family. 

## Appointments 

If you would like to make an appointment, please contact our office by phone or email. New patient appointments are available and welcomed.

## Financial 

We will be more than happy to submit all insurance forms for you and help you recover the most from your benefits. We will do everything we can to help you afford the treatment you need and want. Forms of payment accepted by the office are check, cash, or any major credit card.

## Cancellation 

If you are unable to keep an appointment, we ask that you kindly provide us with at least 24 hours notice. We ask for this advance notice so that we can offer this appointment to another patient. A fee may be charged if a patient does not show up for an appointment without sufficient notice. We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for choosing our practice for your health care.
