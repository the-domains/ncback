# Testimonials 

" When I came to Dr. Stockstad, I was walking with a cane, waddling like a duck and hurting with every step. "Wonder of wonders, Miracle of Miracles" as the song goes. Dr. Stockstad used his "impact adjusting instrument" to adjust my back and when I came up from the table, my back no longer hurt."        A. Albert 

"I have suffered with a pinched nerve in my back and walked hunched over with numbness in my feet. I have tried many treatments and none of them worked. I was getting worse. After three treatments, I can stand straighter and the numbness is going away. Dr. Stockstad knows what he is doing. He is the only one that has helped."        J. J. Sehion 

" I came to Dr. Stockstad's office suffering from Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. At times, my right foot and ankle pain was so bad I would go to the ER for pain injections. I was not able to even have my sheets touch my foot in bed as it would cause intense pain. After treatments, I have been, for the most part, pain free without using pain patches or having any injections for the first time in 12 years."      B. Canipe 

"I had pain in my low back that would radiate down my leg into the heel of my foot. It was so bad that I needed help getting out of bed. My doctor tried muscle relaxers and several injections. None of this seemed to have a lasting effect. After a few visits to Dr. Stockstad, I was able to sleep through the night without waking up due to the pain. I am now able to enjoy life again. I would recommend the treatment (spinal decompression therapy) to anyone who is having pain because it certainly worked for me. Dr. Stockstad is the kindest, most patient and understanding doctor I have ever known J Griffen My Father referred me to Dr. Stockstad after he got great results. When I started seeing Dr. Stockstad I was taking prescription medications and was hardly able to walk and sleeping... forget about it! Now I am exercising and feel 95% better. I highly recommend Dr. Stockstad."          D. Vess
