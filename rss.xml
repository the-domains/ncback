It is about learning, understanding and taking care of your body to improve the quality of  your life.'  We educate our patients about non-surgical and drug free solutions at our Asheville Chiropractic office for common health problems in order to assist you in restoring and maintaining your own health as well as the people around you.  With over 20 years of being Asheville's chiropractor, I understand that although our patients may be diagnosed with the similar conditions, they respond very differently to treatments. For this reason, we tailor a very specific plan of action to meet your needs, goals & unique medical and physical conditions.  Finding a chiropractor in Asheville who understands changing health care needs and the most current techniques and approaches to health problems can be a daunting task. We hope that you will find this site helpful in learning more about our gentle chiropractic care as well as the ways that it can improve the quality of your life.</p>]]></description>
